# Core Workout
This is a small faux-reimplementation of the GNU *core*utils, written in whatever language I wanted to use at the moment.

## Quick Start
```bash
$ git clone "https://www.github.com/FeistyKit/cwo"
$ make -B
```

## Dependencies
For now, the only dependencies are glibc and a C compiler. If I write more things in other languages, then this will change.
